W.Avy would have diffulty running a profitable business if he had to close shop too frequently due to rain. We have access to Hawaii's weather data in an sqlite file which we will query to shed light on W.Avy's concerns.

* Bullet list
  *mean temperature of 75°F for June is higher than the mean temperature of 71°F for December
  *mean precipitation of June, 0.14, is lower than the mean precipitation, 0.22, of December

## Summary

Looking at the statistics, even though mean precipitation is higher in December than it is in June, it is still low enough to justify keeping the shop open. Furthermore, since this is hawaii the temperature doesn't drop below 56 even in December. As an additional query we could filter from the date to see if there is any trend in rainfall during certain weeks.
